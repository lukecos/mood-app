  <main>
    <p>SimpleMoods ("we", "us", or "the App") is a mood‑tracking application that helps users record daily moods and short journal entries. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, stored, and shared, and the choices you have.</p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local app data (required)</strong>: mood ratings (1–5), journal text you enter, and the date/time of each entry. This data is stored locally on your device using app storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & app metadata (automatic)</strong>: basic device and app information (app version, OS version) used for debugging and compatibility; stored locally and may be included in error reports if you enable diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications (optional)</strong>: if you enable push notifications, the App may request permission to send notifications and will obtain a device push token. The push token is only used to deliver notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>No advertising identifiers</strong>: the App does not collect or use advertising identifiers such as Android <code>AD_ID</code> or iOS <em>IDFA</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide functionality: store and display your mood history, enable reminders/notifications, and let you edit or delete entries.</li>
      <li>Improve the App: if you opt in to share diagnostics or crash reports, those help fix bugs and improve reliability.</li>
      <li>No advertising: we do not use your data for targeted advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Where data is stored</h2>
    <p>By default, mood entries and journal text are stored locally on your device only. If you choose to enable any cloud backup, sync, or server features (not enabled by default), your data will be transmitted to the server(s) you authorize. If you plan to add cloud sync, you should update this policy with your server details and data locations.</p>

    <h2>4. Third‑party services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>The app includes libraries such as Expo and Expo Notifications which may provide functionality (e.g., push delivery). These third‑party services may process minimal data (e.g., push tokens) to provide their services. We do not share mood/journal content with ad networks. If you enable analytics or other integrations later, we will update this policy and list the services used.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell or rent personal data to third parties.</li>
      <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, or if you request support and explicitly share data with our support provider.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data retention & deletion</h2>
    <p>Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. To delete your data, use the in‑app delete features (or uninstall the App). If you enable cloud features, contact the address below to request deletion from servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit and at rest, but no system is perfect. Keep your device OS and the app updated. Avoid storing extremely sensitive personal information in journal entries.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access / correct / delete</strong>: You can view, edit, and delete your mood entries in the app. For data stored on any server you enable, contact the address below.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: You can enable or disable push notifications in device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: You may opt out of sharing diagnostics in the app settings (if such a setting is offered).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post changes in the App and update the Effective Date.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions, data requests, or privacy concerns contact: <a href="mailto:lukecose.business@gmail.com">lukecose.business@gmail.com</a></p>

    <footer>
      <p>Important: This policy reflects the app as currently implemented. If you add cloud sync, analytics, advertising, or other features later, update this policy to include concrete details and third‑party service names.</p>
